I used node version 18.12.1 while producing the program, so if the program isn't working with your version of node, a solution might be to switch to this version instead

1. Download all of the files from the GitHub page as a .zip file

2. To preserve all of the course files, extract all of the files to your desired location with winRAR or similar program

2.1 To only download the project application, extract the 'Project work' folder to your desired location
  
3. Open the 'Project work' folder inside of a terminal

4. Run the below command to install the dependencies for the back-end server
```rb
# npm install
```
5. To run the back-end server, run this command
```rb
# npm run start
```
6. For the angular app, navigate to /angular-source/ folder inside of another terminal

7. To install the angular app dependencies, run command
```rb
# npm install
```
8. To run the angular app, run command
```rb
# ng serve
```
9. While both the back-end server and angular app are running, open the website http://localhost:4200 to access the app
